Base Procedure Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

skill1 = team1 skill
skill2 = team2 skill
gMod   = ground mod
	
Optional: 
style1 = team1 style
style2 = team2 style

set base run score probabilities
	i.e. the chance of getting a 4, 6, etc off a hit

initialise 4 empty arrays:
	b1run, b2run   -- to store number of runs by each batsman, by innings
	b1out, b2out   -- to store the method of out for each batsman, by innings

initialise batsmen strength arrays
	b1str, b2str   -- arrays of batsmen strengths; start higher, gradually get lower
	*** adjust these arrays based on style mods. will need to test numbers and make sure team style can't overpower ground mod
	
calculate toHit value based on skill ratio
	adjust toHit for ground mod            -- batting track vs bowling track

run through ball by ball for first innings
for i < 300; i++
	batsman strength + some implementation of rand() vs toHit
		if hit, calculate runs off this ball
			if not 4 or 6, % of out
		if not hit, % of out
			
			if out, calculate type of out
				set b1run value
				set b1out value
				move to next batsman strength value
				
	each ball has % of stoppage; if stopped, set stoppage flag
	
if stoppage, take i as number of balls allowed for second innings (?)
	** needs clarification
	** does this work better as a number of overs instead?

calculate run rate for first innings
calculate wickets lost
calculate targets for second innings based on rates, wickets lost, and number of overs

determine second innings approach (aggressive, patient, defensive, etc)
this will apply a modifier to batsman strength/run probabilities (?)

run through ball by ball for second innings
for j < i; j++
	 batsman strength + some implementation of rand() vs toHit
		if hit, calculate runs off this ball
			if not 4 or 6, % of out
		if not hit, % of out
			
			if out, calculate type of out
				set b2run value
				set b2out value
				move to next batsman strength value

	each ball has % of stoppage; if stopped, set stoppage flag
	
if stoppage, ?????????????????

calculate final totals
